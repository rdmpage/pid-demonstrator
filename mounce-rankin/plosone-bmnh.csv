The skull of this individual is incompletely known, however. The middle length of the jaws, occipital aspect and much of the mandible have broken away, leading most authors to conclude that the NHMUK R3877 skull is primarily represented by two, non-articulating pieces (e.g. , , -). The posterior component reveals a relatively tall orbital region, preserving most of a reclined, partially closed and slender orbit; the posterior region of a large nasoantorbital fenestra that, unusually, extends beyond the jaw joint and a fragment of the articulated posterior mandible. The anterior piece, which also includes the complete mandibular symphysis, contains the anterior end of the nasoantorbital fenestra, the entire dental series and a particularly low, crestless rostrum. The two pieces are separated by sizeable lengths of maxillae and premaxillae in the upper jaw and similar lengths of mandibular rami, but the exact lengths of these missing portions are unknown. No other I. latidens fossils have provided a complete jaw for comparison, although another set of jaws is known: UMZC T706/R392 (accessioned in University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge, and possibly representing the lost jaws of the I. latidens holotype ). This material is badly crushed and the posterior skull remains – including the jaw joint or other hallmarks of the braincase region – are missing (MPW, pers. obs. 2007). Although more of the maxilla and mandible length are preserved in this specimen than BMNH R3877, the distortion of the skull renders it of questionable use in reconstructing the skull proportions of I. latidens and, at best, it only gives a minimum length of the jaws.",,,,,,,,,,,

Boulenger  (p. 43) placed this taxon in the genus Stenophis, provided a redescription and a head drawing and changed the locality to “unknown”. The reasons for rejecting this type locality remain speculative. Günther  noted that the specimen was “From M. Parzudaki's Collection”; Parzudaki collected in Central and South America –. Boulenger , however, placed the specimen in the genus Stenophis based mainly on dental morphology (maxillary teeth “13 or 14, equal”, p. 39–40 vs. “12 or 13, anterior longest”p. 44) and the presence of well-developed hypapophyses throughout the vertebral column. The latter character is used by Boulenger to characterize a very small number of snake genera, including Stenophis and Lycodryas. Because all other Stenophis spp. were from Madagascar, Boulenger most likely doubted the reported origin of the specimen. Notably, the two descriptions of the type specimen disagree in that according to Günther , the anal shield is “bifid”, whereas according to Boulenger  it is “entire”. Our examination supports the view of Günther.",,,,,,,,,,,

Sir Francis Day  described Ophiocephalus diplogramma in 1865 based on one juvenile specimen (42 mm in length) collected near the mouth of the Cochin River in the port city of Cochin (Southwestern India), and called it Malabar snakehead (Holotype at the Natural History Museum, London; BMNH 1865.7.17.24). The color pattern of this juvenile matched with that of juveniles of another species of snakehead, O. micropeltes originally described by Cuvier and Valenciennes  from Java, Indonesia. This possibly led Francis Day to synonymise C. diplogramma with C. micropeltes in 1878 . The close similarity, rarity of adult specimens in museum collections, and the fact that no taxonomist has studied this snakehead since its description, resulted in the acceptance of the synonymy by subsequent taxonomists , –.

Since the types of C. micropeltes were dry (stuffed) specimens, with missing fin rays and dry/damaged scales, we could not do a complete morphometric assessment. We therefore used only the measurements of fresh specimens to do the statistical analyses. The measurements were compared using a two-tailed unpaired t test. For some of the meristic characters where one species did not show any variation, we performed one-sample t test with the character value of the species showing no variation as the hypothetical mean. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the morphometric characters (measured as % TL) and meristic characters using a correlation matrix between the variables to nullify the size and unit effect.

The tip of the snout appears to be strongly consolidated due to the tight suture between the premaxilla and the median rostral (). Although the snout is heavily ossified, it may have been loosely attached to the lateral ethmoid, anterior nasal, and tectal (if present). This condition is also observed in Macropoma lewesiensis (BMNH 4207). The entire surface of the snout is ornamented with coarse rugosities, making it difficult to observe the suture between the bones precisely. The premaxilla is robust, bears no teeth, and is separated at the symphysis from its antimere by a large trapezoidal, median pore of the sensory line canal (m.p.s.c, ). Such a condition is also observed in Macropoma (.20B in ) and Latimeria ( p.s.m.e.m in ), but the median pore of the sensory line canal is much larger in Megalocoelacanthus. The ventral half of the premaxilla is very broad and the base of the bone extends medially as a thin flattened surface that closes ventrally the median pore of the sensory line canal (). The base of the premaxilla meets its antimere in a recess, posterior to the opening of the median pore of the sensory line canal. The anteroventral margin of the premaxilla is slightly folded ventrally, and crenate. Ventrally, the right premaxilla presents a raised area pierced by a pore that is directed posteroventrally.

Our phylogenetic analysis of Megalocoelacanthus supports the sister-group relationship with Libys, an Upper Jurassic genus from Bavaria, Germany. Although it is significantly smaller in size, Libys shares many features with Megalocoelacanthus. Notably, this genus also possesses a supraorbital sensory line canal that opens through a large, continuous groove stretched by pillars on either side of the parietonasal shield. When specimens of Libys are observed under binocular microscope (Dutel pers. obs. on BSPG XIV 501b, BSPG 1870 XIV 502, BMNH P3337), one can distinguish a suture between the base of adjacent pillars. It is thus probable that the same condition is present in Megalocoelacanthus, but because of the poor preservation, the suture between the supraorbitals cannot be seen. Despite the size difference, the lower jaw of Megalocoelacanthus and Libys are virtually identical, i.e. a slender and elongated mandible opened by large pores for the mandibular sensory line canal. These two genera also share the absence of a suture between the parasphenoid and the basisphenoid, which suggests fusion of the two bones, the presence of a narrow and unornamented parietonasal shield, and the palatoquadrate being very deep and short in length with a ventral swelling on the palate. Very few elements from the postcranial skeleton are present on the specimen AMNH FF 20267. However, the pectoral girdle which is preserved is virtually identical in shape and proportion in Megalocoelacanthus and Libys: the cleithrum is slender and elongated, and the clavicle is relatively very small compared to the whole pectoral girdle.",,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the ilium of Mymoorapelta is flat in lateral view (). Ventrally, the acetabulum is formed between the moderately long pubic peduncle and squat, swollen ischial peduncle. It is located about midway between the medial and lateral margins of the ilium. The axis of the acetabulum is angled 50° posteriorly from an axis through the middle of the acetabulum perpendicular to the sacral vertebrae. This angle causes the femur to swing anterolaterally so that the knee clears the expanded gut; the femur does not move in a parasagittal plane. The preacetabular process has a crest ventrally that extends forwards from near the pubic peduncle. Anteriorly, this crest becomes the ventral margin of the preacetabular process. Near the pubic peduncle, this preacetabular crest separates a narrow shelf (the preacetabular shelf) from the main body of the preacetabular process. This shelf may have been for the origin for part of the M. iliotibialis. The preacetabular shelf and associated crest are present in Scelidosaurus, although are not as well developed. They are absent in Huayangosaurus and most stegosaurs, except Dacentrurus (BMNH 46013) and an unnamed Dacentrurus-like pelvis from China ( fig. 5f).",,,,,,,,,,,

The opposing articular surfaces of the dorsal and sacral centra are somewhat irregular and interlocking, thus resembling the typical irregular surface between sacral vertebrae of immature dinosaurs and implies the two vertebrae of Scelidosaurus were tightly interlocked. There is no caudal incorporated into the synsacrum. The sacrum of Scelidosaurus is composed of four vertebrae, which are unfused in BMNH R1111, owing to the immaturity of the specimen (the condition is unknown in the larger specimen represented by SGDS 131 due to matrix). The neural spines are distinct and not fused into a plate as seen in later ankylosaurs. Within the acetabulum, a ventral portion of sacrals 1 and 2 form a small part of the dorsomedial rim of the acetabulum, as it does in Gargoyleosaurus, as well as Gastonia, and Edmontonia (NMC 8531); the ribs are excluded from the acetabulum in primitive ornithischians (e.g., ) and stegosaurs, including Huayangosaurus.",,,,,,,,,,,

In the west it is currently known from north-west South Africa westward through Namibia, and just entering into south-west Angola (; []). These geographically isolated distributions coincide with two of the currently recognized subspecies of R. darlingi, R. darlingi darlingi and R. darlingi damarensis []. The holotype (BMNH 1895.8.27.1) of R. d. darlingi comes from Mazowe, Mashonaland, Zimbabwe, while that of R. d. damarensis (TM 9474) was from Oserikari, Damaraland, Okahandja District, in Namibia (). For this study, R. darlingi individuals were sampled together with several other rhinolophid species (Table S1 and Appendix S1 in ) at several sites in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe from 2008 to 2012 (). Species identifications were based on Monadjem et al. []. Wherever possible one male and one female were taken as vouchers from each site sampled. All other bats were released unharmed back into their roosts after data and tissue sample collection. We also obtained morphometric data and tissue samples from museum specimens of R. d. darlingi (See Table S2 and Appendix S1 in ). ",,,,,,,,,,,

The bone is massive, the proximo-distal length of the distal portion measuring more than 370 mm (), and one can estimate the total length of the whole bone to around 1110 mm based on the length and proportion of the femur of Megalosaurus bucklandii (BMNH 31806; ). The minimum circumference of the shaft is 370 mm at the level of the break and its transversal ratio (lateromedial width/anteroposterior width) is 1.44.",,,,,,,,,,,

Nine specimens each of the TMM-M U. woodmasoni and B. rhodogaster (completely disarticulated individuals not scored), and a previously CT-scanned specimen of Plectrurus aureus from the California Academy of Science (CAS 17177)  were additionally scored and included. The specimens of uropeltids from the Natural History Museum, London (BMNH), upon which the original character descriptions were based , also were examined and re-scored in person (JCO), except for the specimen of ‘Teretrurus rhodogaster’ (BMNH 1930.5.8.98), which was unavailable. Scores for the original outgroup taxa were checked using skeletal specimens from the University of California Museum of Paleontology (Cylindrophis rufus, UCMP 136995) and CT data (Anomochilus and Anilius) provided to us by the Squamate Tree of Life project (Deep Scaly).

That is not surprising, however, given that many more specimens were available for those two taxa. The variation in U. woodmasoni and B. rhodogaster does not appear to be bimodal (within the limited sample sizes), and therefore is unlikely to be related to sexual dimorphism, although that phenomenon has not been studied in uropeltids. Additionally, all TMM specimens of U. woodmasoni were collected from the same locality, reducing the possibility for geographic variation (). Most TMM specimens of B. rhodogaster also were collected from a single locality, although notably, no data were available for the potentially misidentified TMM M-10025, and TMM M-10026 and TMM M-10027 are listed only as from ‘S. India’ (). Note that our score for the absence of the interchoanal process in B. rhodogaster differs from that reported previously for a specimen of B. rhodogaster originally identified as ‘Teretrurus rhodogaster’ (BMNH 1930.5.8.59) . That and other scoring differences (Methods S2), as well as the results of our phylogenetic analysis, suggest that our B. rhodogaster and that specimen of ‘T. rhodogaster’ may not be conspecific. It is possible that either BMNH 1930.5.8.59 is Teretrurus sanguineus or that our specimens were misidentified, although nearly all TMM specimens of B. rhodogaster were collected from the type locality for B. rhodogaster",,,,,,,,,,,

On the afternoon of 26th July 2010 one of us (MW) observed the approximately last 30 seconds of an episode of active skin feeding, in which the normally quiescent hatchlings were moving rapidly over and around mainly the middle region of the body of their motionless mother, removing and ingesting pieces of her skin. Immediately following this the mother and young were observed for a further approximately 30 seconds during which the mother remained motionless and the young moved very slowly upon soil adjacent to the mother. This was our only direct observation of any post-hatching parental care. By 28th July the mass of the presumed mother had decreased from 3.7 to 3.09 g while the combined mass of the two hatchlings increased from 0.5 to 0.89 g. After a further six days the mass of the presumed mother had fallen further to 2.85 g and the combined mass of the two young had increased to 0.93 g.

From this point onwards the animals were offered live foods (earthworms and crickets). Both the presumed mother and the young subsequently increased in mass such that on 17th October 2010 the presumed mother weighed 3.6 g, close to her previous mass, and the combined mass of the young was 1.79 g, and their lengths were 102 and 111 mm.",,,,,,,,,,,

The ethmosphenoid portion of the skull bears nine vacuities and the otoccipital portion five. Slender pillars (pi, , , , ) separate adjacent vacuities. Several pillars display a clear separation between their dorsal edge and the parietonasal shield. This could be attributed to the lateral compression, or it could suggest that most of the pillars may have been sutured to the parietonasal shield. We support the latter assumption based on the presence of clear suture between the anteriormost pillar and the lateral rostral on both side of the skull. Consequently, we identify the pillars as expansions of the supraorbital series. The condition observed in Megalocoelacanthus is thus very similar to that of the Jurassic genus Libys, where the pillars forming the large vacuity of the supraorbital sensory line canal are interpreted as elements of the supraorbital series (Dutel pers. obs. on BMNH P.3337). A twist in the orientation of the pillars is observable along the antero-posterior axis (, ). The first three pillars are oriented anterodorsally whereas the more posterior ones are oriented posterodorsally. The supratemporal bears one pillar, the posterior parietal four, the anterior parietal two, and the anteriormost ones are borne by the nasals. A vacuity occurs between the edges of adjacent bones of the parietonasal series (i.e. posterior parietal/anterior parietal; anterior parietal/nasal). The suture between the bones of the parietonasal series extends through the vacuity and is subsequently overlapped by the ventral edge of the cavity (). This suggests that the parietonasal series could have extended laterally on both sides of the skull, so that it was overlapped by the supraorbital series. The first three vacuities are more dorsal in position than the posterior one. Their shapes are also different along the antero-posterior axis (): the anteriormost vacuities are dorsoventrally flattened while the posteriormost are anteroposteriorly flattened. This suggests that on either side, the branches of the sensory line canal were oriented anteromedially along the ethmosphenoid portion of the skull, meeting dorsomedially behind the lateral rostral to form the antorbital sensory line canal commissure (ant.com.so.s.c, ). The position of the antorbital commissure is thus at the same level along the shield as in Latimeria",,,,,,,,,,,

The humerus (BMNH M 85318; ) is a complete left bone with minimal damage on the regions of the lateral supinator crest and the medial epicondyle. The bone is relatively short and robust (humeral width to length = 32%, Index 1 in ; cf. functional interpretation). The humeral head is large, laterally compressed and appears convex in lateral and medial views, the neck bowing moderately ventrally. The lesser tuberosity, where an important medial rotator muscle of the shoulder inserts (i.e., M. subscapularis), is tightly pressed against the dorsomedial surface of the humeral head. Dorsolaterally to and slightly above this head rises the greater tuberosity for the attachment of muscles involved in the lateral rotation of the shoulder and abduction initiation (i.e., M. teres minor, M. supraspinatus, and especially M. infraspinatus for which a prominent pit is present on the ventrolateral border of the tuberosity). In proximal view, the greater tuberosity has an oblique direction relative to the dorsoventral axis. It extends dorsally, delineating with the lesser tuberosity a wide and shallow bicipital groove for the tendon of M. biceps brachii, involved in the supination and flexion of the elbow. The deltopectoral crest, where important muscles for abduction, adduction, extension and medial rotation of the forelimb insert, rises above the humeral shaft. It extends dorsally and distally from the greater tuberosity to about three-fourths down of the bone, and tapers to merge with the diaphysis. The distal part of the humerus is divided into a curved trochlea for articulation with the ulna and a slightly convex capitulum for articulation with the radius. Moreover, the medial rim of the trochlea is more distal than the capitulum and the medial epicondyle. In ventral view, a supratrochlear foramen and a deep fossa are visible proximal to the trochlea. The distal humerus shows a strong medial epicondyle protruding ventrally, maybe related to the presence of an entepicondylar foramen . From this epicondyle originate the M. pronator teres as well as carpal and digital flexors. The broken proximal part of the medial epicondyle prevents to check the presence of an entepicondylar foramen. The lateral epicondyle is relatively short. In lateral view, it bears a prominent scar which is probably the insertion site for the common extensor tendon, origin of the digital and carpal extensors. A relatively developed lateral supinator crest extends proximoventrally to merge with the diaphysis about one-thirds the length of the bone.",,,,,,,,,,,

A. macrognathus (the best represented Apterodon species) and A. altidens are known from the late Eocene-early Oligocene beds of the Jebel Qatrani Formation –, . The oldest egyptian species, A. saghensis, is recovered from the late Eocene Qasr el-Sagha Formation . A. langebadreae nov. sp. exhibits smaller proportions compared to A. macrognathus (– and , ). The new Lybian species differs from it by the presence of a talonid basin on m2 and a M3 metaconule. Concerning the postcranial remains, the humerus of A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs from that of A. macrognathus (BMNH M 9257, cast of CGM 9445; figured by Andrews , pp. 229) in having a more developed lateral epicondyle and a stronger dorsoventral shortening of the distal part of the diaphysis relative to the proximal one. The flange of the anconeal process of the ulna is also less elongated proximomedially and the ventral ridge of the scar for the M. abductor pollicis longus is more dorsally placed than in the broken ulna of A. macrognathus (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described in Schlosser , pp. 80). The radial head is more curved in dorsal view with a higher capitular eminence by comparison to the complete radius SMNS 43467 attributed to A. macrognathus (described in Schlosser , pp. 80). Finally, no significant differences are observable relative to the fragmentary tibia of the Egyptian species (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described by Schlosser , pp. 80–81). A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs also from A. altidens by the presence of a m2 talonid basin and by an unreduced metacone and metastyle on M2, a wider M3 () on which is present a parastyle, a lower paracone, a wider protocone, and a more vestigial metacone. The third Fayum species, A. saghensis, is represented by a mandible only bearing p2–p4 and the basal crown of m1. This mandible shows smaller teeth compared to A. langebadreae nov. sp. () and the p4 is more than half higher than p3. The height difference between these premolars is much more important than in A. langebadreae nov. sp., although this character is likely to be variable within species .

The anteromedial pneumatic recess, also known as the pneumatic excavation , , is homologous to the posteromedial maxillary fenestra but differs from the latter by not leading to a maxillary antrum. An anteromedial pneumatic recess can be observed in many megalosauroids such as Piatnitzkysaurus (PVL 4073), Marshosaurus (UMNH 7825), Eustreptospondylus (OUMNH J.13558), Afrovenator (MNN UBA1), Megalosaurus (OUMNH J.13506) and Duriavenator (BMNH R.332).",,,,,,,,,,,

In ML 1100, the interdental plates extend almost as far ventral as the lateral wall, whereas the interdental plates of T. tanneri fall short and end well dorsal of the lateral wall of the maxillary body. This later feature is considered to be a synapomorphical character of the clade encompassing Torvosaurus and Megalosaurus by Benson  and Carrano et al. . It can also be observed in other theropods such as the tyrannosauroids Guanlong, Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus and the allosauroids Allosaurus and Neovenator (see ; pers. obs.). Britt  remarked that this character may be due to crushing but examination of ML 1186 seems to reveal that the interdental plates genuinely end well dorsal to the lateral wall of the maxilla. Nonetheless, it is difficult to know whether this feature can variate ontogenetically, intraspecifically or can genuinely distinguish two taxa. Based on very large and similar size of their maxillae, ML 1100 and BYU-VP 9122 clearly belong to animals of the same size and ontogenetic stage, and most likely fully adult individuals of more than nine meters (see below), so that ontogenetic variation cannot be taken into consideration. The maxillae of the different specimens of Dilophosaurus wetherilli (UCMP 37303, TMM 43646-1; Fig. S1), Ceratosaurus nasicornis (UMNH VP 5278; MWC 1), Majungasaurus crenatissimus (FMNH PR 2100, 2278), Marshosaurus bicentesimus (UMNH VP 7824, 7825; CMNH 21704), Megalosaurus bucklandii (BMNH R.8303; OUMNH J13506, 13559), Allosaurus fragilis (AMNH 600, 851; BYU-VP 2008; UMNH VP 5393, 9168, USNM 8335) and Tyrannosaurus rex (CMNH 9380; FMNH PR 2081; BHI 3033) all show similar ventral extension of the interdental plates. On the other hand, the two species of Carcharodontosaurus, C. saharicus (SGM Din–1) and C. iguidensis (MNN IGU2) can be differentiated on this aspect as the interdental plates of the former extend more ventral than the latter (pers. obs.). Based on this observation, the ventral extension of the interdental plate relative to the lateral wall may genuinely variate interspecifically and this feature is therefore considered to be a synapomorphical character differentiating the two species of Torvosaurus. To our knowledge, the presence of an interdental wall coincidental with the lateral wall of the maxillary body is an autapomorphical feature of T. gurneyi among Megalosauroidea.",,,,,,,,,,,

Davies). Lammidhan appears on Davies’ unpublished map and is located on a broad alluvial plain. However, it does not match a modern topographical landmark and its meaning is not known to local people. Eocene deposits occur to the north and south of the plain, with marine limestones and muds forming ledges usually towering over the unconsolidated muds that form the bottoms of valleys. These muds are the “Planorbis Freshwater beds,” and it is our contention that the specimen may have been found on these beds, but that it rolled down from overlying marine beds.

A non-type specimen from the Stephen’s collection (BMNH(E) 1239047) was used to validate the method prior to attempting the extraction from the lectotype specimen (BMNH(E) 1239048). All lab equipment and areas were cleaned with DNA Away surface decontaminant (Thermo Scientific), and new consumables and reagents were used to prevent cross contamination of DNA between extraction of the test specimen and subsequent extraction of the lectotype. In each case a single leg was removed and genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Micro kit as per manufacturer’s protocol “Isolation of genomic DNA from tissues”, modified by initially grinding the leg with a plastic micro-pestle in 20μl 1xTE buffer before the addition of lysis buffer (180 μl buffer ALT and 20μl proteinase K). The tissues were incubated at 56°C overnight (approx. 17 hours). In addition 1μg of carrier RNA was added to buffer AL at the appropriate stage. Cytochrome oxidase subunit (COI) sequences were amplified in eight separate reactions using the primer pairs designed by referring to COI sequences of the genus Chrysoperla deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (, .) in addition to C1-J-1718 and TL2-N-3014 []. Each reaction consisted of 1mM total dNTPs, 3mM MgCl2, 1.25u Bio-Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline), 0.1μM each primer and 1x reaction buffer (67mM Tris-HCl, 16mM (NH4)2SO4, 10mM KCl). Cycling conditions were: initial denaturation 94°C for 1 m followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, with a final elongation of 10 m at 72°C. To increase the potential DNA yield from the lectotype the abdomen was extracted separately from the leg using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Micro kit as per manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications to minimise damage to external morphology: the abdomen was removed and soaked whole in buffer ATL with proteinase K at 56°C overnight, rather than ground or vortexed. 1μg of carrier RNA was added to buffer AL. Following extraction the abdomen was washed in 500μl of TE buffer, then in a series of TE/ethanol dilutions (50% ethanol for 5 hours at 4°c then 70% ethanol for 16 hours at 4°c) before being stored in 100% ethanol and imaged with a Zeiss Axio Zoom v.16 stereo microscope ().

The ascending ramus is broken dorsally, behind the m3 alveolar level, and distally before the condyles. The horizontal ramus shows three mental foramina in lateral view: beneath the p1–p2 contact, the p3–p4 contact, and a very small one under the p3 distal root. On DT25-1, the last mental foramina is absent or fused with the second one. In medial view, the mandibular symphysis extends ventrodistally to end at the level of the p3 distal root. The mental foramen opens approximately 3.5 cm behind the m3, slightly beneath the alveolar level. The jaw is rather shallow and particularly long, measuring approximately 16 cm from the beginning of the tooth row to the most distal part of the remaining ascending ramus.",,,,,,,,,,,

Except a small diastema visible between p2 and p3, the teeth are closely set together. The teeth morphology is more tubercular than sectorial as shown by the bulbous cusps. The incisors are so crowded that i1–i2 alveoli are located along a vertical axis. The canine is large and tends towards the labial side of the jaw. The p1 is single-rooted and more labially situated than the p2, as indicated by the alveolus. The other premolars of the jaw are two-rooted. The p2 and p3 are low-crowned and simply built: they bear a unique cusp, mesially placed with respect to the crown length, making the teeth asymmetrical in occlusal and lateral views. The p2 is more asymmetrical than the p3. Mesial and distal crests extend from the main cusps of these premolars to join the crown base. The p4 shows a tall main cusp, centrally positioned relative to the crown length, a tiny mesial shelf and a short and low talonid. The better preserved p4 on DT25-1 shows a talonid bearing an oblique cristid obliqua. Mesial and distal crests extend from the main cusp to join mesially the crown base and distally the cristid obliqua. The length and height of the premolars increase from p2 to p4. They are surrounded by a thick cingulid, more pronounced on the lingual side than on the labial one for BMNH M 85298 and at least well developed on the lingual side for the p4 of DT25-1 (worn labial side). The m1 is shorter than the p4, m2 and m3. It is broken and worn until the crown base, only the lingual side and the distolabial part of the talonid enamel being preserved. The trigonid outline is however visible. It seems to have retained a metaconid base and is slightly longer than the talonid. The poorly preserved m1 on DT25-1 shows also a shallow talonid basin. The m2 and m3 have a similar length. The trigonid is higher than the talonid. The paraconid, bending lingually, is the smallest cusp of the trigonid. The protoconid is the highest trigonid cusp. It is broader and distolabially situated relative to the paraconid. A faint enamel fold, which can be assumed as a vestigial metaconid, stands up on the distolingual side of the protoconid. This feature is visible on m3 but was certainly present on m2 also, the reduction of the metaconid being generally more important for the distal molars than for the mesial ones. The carnassial notch on the paracristid is short and feebly transversal, due to the weak lingual and labial extensions of the paraconid and the protoconid, respectively. A small precingulid rises just labial and basal to the paraconid. The paraconid position relative to the protoconid is more lingual in m3 than in m2. This makes the paracristid more transversally oriented in m3. Moreover, compared to the m2, the m3 paraconid and protoconid are higher and the precingulid is more developed. The talonid breadth is similar to the trigonid one in m2 but smaller in m3. Parallel to the labial border of these two molars, the talonid bears a short and weakly oblique cristid obliqua, extending distally from the base of the protoconid distal face to join a prominent and bulbous hypoconid. The hypoconid and the protoconid are aligned mesiodistally in m2. The hypoconid in m3 is slightly more lingual than the protoconid. In both molars, the labial cingulid stands up abruptely on the distal talonid, merging with the hypoconulid. The m2 hypoconulid is slightly lower than the hypoconid and separated from it by a narrow posthypocristid. These cusps are worn in m3. The m2 talonid also bears a shallow basin, absent in m3. Both molars have a crestiform entoconid surrounding lingually the talonid and merging mesially with the lingual cingulid.",,,,,,,,,,,

The most ventral part shows two scars which are probably the insertion sites of the M. rectus capitis posterior minor. The axial skeleton is represented by several vertebrae and a rib. Fragments of two cervicals are preserved. BMNH M 85335 shows a dorsally broken spinous process. Ventral to this process, zygapophysis processes are present laterally and medially. The spinal canal is wide and the underneath vertebral body (centrum) is ovoid in proximal view and triangular-shaped in distal one. The more ventral transverse processes are thin, oriented ventrolaterally and ventromedially, and show small transversarium foramina at their base. The specimen BMNH M 85335 seems to have a more distal position on the vertebral column compared to BMNH M 85313 as indicated by its wider spinal canal and its more mesially inclined spinous process. Both vertebrae can be c3–c6 as the c7 misses transversarium foramina and as the c1–c2 lacks a centrum and presents an odontoid process, respectively. The rib (BMNH M 85330) shows two articular surfaces with a vertebra: a dorsal tuberculum, which articulates with the transverse process, and a ventral capitulum, which meets on adjacent vertebral centra. As both structures are present and well-separated on this bone, it belongs probably to the proximal thoracic ribs.",,,,,,,,,,,

BMNH M 85315 is a subcomplete left bone, lacking its femoral head, and BMNH M 85317 and 85316 are proximal and distal epiphyses, respectively, of a right femur. The femur is longer than the humerus (). It is compressed dorsoventrally and its proximal part is twisted medially. On the specimen BMNH M 85317, the head, which articulates with the acetabulum, is nearly round and does not extend on the femoral neck. The neck is relatively long, so that the femoral head is bowed medially. In medial view, the fovea capitis, an ovoid depression where inserts the ligamentum teres, is located ventrally. Laterally to the femoral head lies a roughened greater trochanter for the attachment of the M. gluteus medius, M. gluteus profundus and M. piriformis, powerful hip extensors. It stands below the level of the femoral head. Distal to the proximal end of the femur are the lesser and third trochanters (on BMNH M 85315 and 85317). Below the femoral head, the prominent medial lesser trochanter, where the M. iliopsoas inserts, projects more medially than ventrally. Between the lesser and greater trochanters lies on BMNH M 85315 a deep trochanteric fossa, the attachment area of several lateral hip rotators. The trochanteric line, bordering laterally this fossa, is very thick. The lateral third trochanter, distal to the greater trochanter, is well-developed and slightly ventral. It is the insertion area of the M. gluteus superficialis. The distal femur bears a medial condyle more ventrally developed than the lateral one. In distal view, the patellar trochlea is weakly grooved and appears slightly more extended dorsoventrally than wide mediolaterally. The intercondylar fossa is as deep dorsoventrally as wide mediolaterally. The medial epicondyle bears a deep central depression, where may have been attached the medial collateral ligament, and a smaller pit, just proximal to it. This last area could be the attachment site of the medial head of the M. gastrocnemius, involved in plantar and knee flexions. The lateral epicondyle is rugose and bears distinct pits, certainly related to the insertion of tendons such as that of M. popliteus, which provides the flexion of the leg upon the thigh and unlocks the knee by rotating the tibia inward. They also might contain the insertion site of the lateral collateral ligament.",,,,,,,,,,,

The humerus (BMNH M 85318; ) is a complete left bone with minimal damage on the regions of the lateral supinator crest and the medial epicondyle. The bone is relatively short and robust (humeral width to length = 32%, Index 1 in ; cf. functional interpretation). The humeral head is large, laterally compressed and appears convex in lateral and medial views, the neck bowing moderately ventrally. The lesser tuberosity, where an important medial rotator muscle of the shoulder inserts (i.e., M. subscapularis), is tightly pressed against the dorsomedial surface of the humeral head. Dorsolaterally to and slightly above this head rises the greater tuberosity for the attachment of muscles involved in the lateral rotation of the shoulder and abduction initiation (i.e., M. teres minor, M. supraspinatus, and especially M. infraspinatus for which a prominent pit is present on the ventrolateral border of the tuberosity). In proximal view, the greater tuberosity has an oblique direction relative to the dorsoventral axis. It extends dorsally, delineating with the lesser tuberosity a wide and shallow bicipital groove for the tendon of M. biceps brachii, involved in the supination and flexion of the elbow. The deltopectoral crest, where important muscles for abduction, adduction, extension and medial rotation of the forelimb insert, rises above the humeral shaft. It extends dorsally and distally from the greater tuberosity to about three-fourths down of the bone, and tapers to merge with the diaphysis. The distal part of the humerus is divided into a curved trochlea for articulation with the ulna and a slightly convex capitulum for articulation with the radius. Moreover, the medial rim of the trochlea is more distal than the capitulum and the medial epicondyle. In ventral view, a supratrochlear foramen and a deep fossa are visible proximal to the trochlea. The distal humerus shows a strong medial epicondyle protruding ventrally, maybe related to the presence of an entepicondylar foramen . From this epicondyle originate the M. pronator teres as well as carpal and digital flexors. The broken proximal part of the medial epicondyle prevents to check the presence of an entepicondylar foramen. The lateral epicondyle is relatively short. In lateral view, it bears a prominent scar which is probably the insertion site for the common extensor tendon, origin of the digital and carpal extensors. A relatively developed lateral supinator crest extends proximoventrally to merge with the diaphysis about one-thirds the length of the bone.",,,,,,,,,,,

It is slightly shorter than the humerus (). The diaphysis is slightly compressed lateromedially and somewhat curved in lateral view. The proximal olecranon, where the major extensor of the forelimb (i.e., M. triceps) inserts, does not bend dorsally or ventrally with respect to the longitudinal axis of the bone, but is slightly medially inclined. It is long relative to the entire length of the ulna (approximately as long as the semilunar notch), as found generally in hyaenodontidans  (olecranon to ulnar length = 22%, Index 2 in ; cf. functional interpretation). Below the olecranon, the dorsal semilunar notch for the distal humerus is concave. Immediately distal to the lateral part of this notch is a relatively flat radial notch for the contact with the proximal radius. This notch is elongated dorsomedially to ventrolaterally but somewhat more dorsally directed. In dorsal view, the flange of the anconeal process, proximal to the semilunar notch, is concave and asymmetrical. Its medial rim is more proximal than the lateral one. A deep and longitudinal groove for the M. abductor pollicis longus (abductor of the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint and partial abductor of the wrist) is present along the lateral side of the ulna. Just lateral to the semilunar notch, this groove is delineated by a strong ventral ridge, where might be inserted the M. flexor digitorum profundus, a powerful digital flexor. A thinner ridge, more dorsally located and immediately distal to the semilunar notch, contributes to delineate the dorsal side of the groove. These ridges taper distally to disappear at the two-thirds of the bone, at the level of the interosseous tubercle which projects laterally. On the dorsodistal surface of the ulna, the region for the M. pronator quadratus, the main forearm pronator, is partly broken. The distal ulna presents a small radial facet for articulation with the ulnar facet of the radius, and a more distal and ventral massive styloid process for the articulation with the carpal.",,,,,,,,,,,

The contact facet with the tibia is unidentified regarding the poor preservation state of the distal tibia. Two facets with the tarsal bones are visible on the lateral malleolus: the more lateral and distal one is in contact with the dorsal facet of the calcaneus, and the more medial and proximal one articulates with the lateral facet of the astragalus. The calcaneal facet of the fibula has a sinuous lateral edge and is dorsoventrally oblique. The astragalar facet is nearly oriented in the proximodistal axis of the bone. The separation between the two facets is roughly defined, except near the ventral crest which joins the lateral edge of both surfaces. Together with a substantial lateral protuberance, located proximally and laterally relative to the lateral malleolus, the ventral crest draws a large concave surface, analogous to the structure developed in other hyaenodontidans (i.e., Sinopa grangeri",,,,,,,,,,,

Right and left innominate fragments are preserved. The left portion (BMNH M 85332; ) is the less damaged one. It lacks the complete pubis and ilium. The ilium is broken proximally, just in front of the anterior inferior iliac spine. This spine, close to the acetabulum, has a very distal position. It is marked by a deep pit visible in dorsal view. The ilium neck is short and broader than the proximal branches of the pubis and the ischium. In lateral view, the acetabulum appears circular and is delineated proximally and dorsally by a high rim. Its lunate articular surface opens distoventrally. A broad rugosity, where inserts the M. rectus femoris, a powerful hip flexor and knee extensor, lies immediately proximal to the acetabulum. Ventrally to the acetabulum, a broad tuberosity for the M. iliopsoas, involved in flexion and lateral rotation at the hip joint, is present. The ramus of the ischium is relatively flat lateromedially. The acetabulum and the descending ramus of the ischium face more laterally than ventrally, as the descending ramus is not deflected outwards with respect to the ilium. Distal and dorsal to the acetabulum, the ischial spine, usually bearing the M. gemelli (lateral rotator and hip abductor), is poorly convex. Even if the pubis and the ischium are not entirely preserved, the obturator foramen, distal to the acetabulum, has been probably broad and elongated proximodistally.",,,,,,,,,,,

A. macrognathus (the best represented Apterodon species) and A. altidens are known from the late Eocene-early Oligocene beds of the Jebel Qatrani Formation –, . The oldest egyptian species, A. saghensis, is recovered from the late Eocene Qasr el-Sagha Formation . A. langebadreae nov. sp. exhibits smaller proportions compared to A. macrognathus (– and , ). The new Lybian species differs from it by the presence of a talonid basin on m2 and a M3 metaconule. Concerning the postcranial remains, the humerus of A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs from that of A. macrognathus (BMNH M 9257, cast of CGM 9445; figured by Andrews , pp. 229) in having a more developed lateral epicondyle and a stronger dorsoventral shortening of the distal part of the diaphysis relative to the proximal one. The flange of the anconeal process of the ulna is also less elongated proximomedially and the ventral ridge of the scar for the M. abductor pollicis longus is more dorsally placed than in the broken ulna of A. macrognathus (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described in Schlosser , pp. 80). The radial head is more curved in dorsal view with a higher capitular eminence by comparison to the complete radius SMNS 43467 attributed to A. macrognathus (described in Schlosser , pp. 80). Finally, no significant differences are observable relative to the fragmentary tibia of the Egyptian species (unnumbered specimen from SMNS; described by Schlosser , pp. 80–81). A. langebadreae nov. sp. differs also from A. altidens by the presence of a m2 talonid basin and by an unreduced metacone and metastyle on M2, a wider M3 () on which is present a parastyle, a lower paracone, a wider protocone, and a more vestigial metacone. The third Fayum species, A. saghensis, is represented by a mandible only bearing p2–p4 and the basal crown of m1. This mandible shows smaller teeth compared to A. langebadreae nov. sp. () and the p4 is more than half higher than p3. The height difference between these premolars is much more important than in A. langebadreae nov. sp., although this character is likely to be variable within species . However, the attribution of the Qasr el-Sagha mandible to a separate species relative to the two other Fayum taxa is also questionable, premolars of Apterodon bearing very few characters to be diagnostic at the species level.",,,,,,,,,,,

BMNH M.15792, left m2–3 and right m3, from ‘Lammidhan’ and ‘Planorbis freshwater beds.’ Pilgrim never visited the type region, and the fossils were collected by a geological surveyor (T. G. B. Davies). Lammidhan appears on Davies’ unpublished map and is located on a broad alluvial plain. However, it does not match a modern topographical landmark and its meaning is not known to local people. Eocene deposits occur to the north and south of the plain, with marine limestones and muds forming ledges usually towering over the unconsolidated muds that form the bottoms of valleys.

BMNH M.15792, left m2–3 and right m3, from ‘Lammidhan’ and ‘Planorbis freshwater beds.’ Pilgrim never visited the type region, and the fossils were collected by a geological surveyor (T. G. B. Davies). Lammidhan appears on Davies’ unpublished map and is located on a broad alluvial plain. However, it does not match a modern topographical landmark and its meaning is not known to local people. Eocene deposits occur to the north and south of the plain, with marine limestones and muds forming ledges usually towering over the unconsolidated muds that form the bottoms of valleys. These muds are the “Planorbis Freshwater beds,” and it is our contention that the specimen may have been found on these beds, but that it rolled down from overlying marine beds.

The ethmosphenoid portion of the skull bears nine vacuities and the otoccipital portion five. Slender pillars (pi, , , , ) separate adjacent vacuities. Several pillars display a clear separation between their dorsal edge and the parietonasal shield. This could be attributed to the lateral compression, or it could suggest that most of the pillars may have been sutured to the parietonasal shield. We support the latter assumption based on the presence of clear suture between the anteriormost pillar and the lateral rostral on both side of the skull. Consequently, we identify the pillars as expansions of the supraorbital series. The condition observed in Megalocoelacanthus is thus very similar to that of the Jurassic genus Libys, where the pillars forming the large vacuity of the supraorbital sensory line canal are interpreted as elements of the supraorbital series (Dutel pers. obs. on BMNH P.3337). A twist in the orientation of the pillars is observable along the antero-posterior axis (, ). The first three pillars are oriented anterodorsally whereas the more posterior ones are oriented posterodorsally. The supratemporal bears one pillar, the posterior parietal four, the anterior parietal two, and the anteriormost ones are borne by the nasals. A vacuity occurs between the edges of adjacent bones of the parietonasal series (i.e. posterior parietal/anterior parietal; anterior parietal/nasal). The suture between the bones of the parietonasal series extends through the vacuity and is subsequently overlapped by the ventral edge of the cavity (). This suggests that the parietonasal series could have extended laterally on both sides of the skull, so that it was overlapped by the supraorbital series. The first three vacuities are more dorsal in position than the posterior one. Their shapes are also different along the antero-posterior axis (): the anteriormost vacuities are dorsoventrally flattened while the posteriormost are anteroposteriorly flattened. This suggests that on either side, the branches of the sensory line canal were oriented anteromedially along the ethmosphenoid portion of the skull, meeting dorsomedially behind the lateral rostral to form the antorbital sensory line canal commissure (ant.com.so.s.c, ). The position of the antorbital commissure is thus at the same level along the shield as in Latimeria",,,,,,,,,,,

In ML 1100, the interdental plates extend almost as far ventral as the lateral wall, whereas the interdental plates of T. tanneri fall short and end well dorsal of the lateral wall of the maxillary body. This later feature is considered to be a synapomorphical character of the clade encompassing Torvosaurus and Megalosaurus by Benson  and Carrano et al. . It can also be observed in other theropods such as the tyrannosauroids Guanlong, Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus and the allosauroids Allosaurus and Neovenator (see ; pers. obs.). Britt  remarked that this character may be due to crushing but examination of ML 1186 seems to reveal that the interdental plates genuinely end well dorsal to the lateral wall of the maxilla. Nonetheless, it is difficult to know whether this feature can variate ontogenetically, intraspecifically or can genuinely distinguish two taxa. Based on very large and similar size of their maxillae, ML 1100 and BYU-VP 9122 clearly belong to animals of the same size and ontogenetic stage, and most likely fully adult individuals of more than nine meters (see below), so that ontogenetic variation cannot be taken into consideration. The maxillae of the different specimens of Dilophosaurus wetherilli (UCMP 37303, TMM 43646-1; Fig. S1), Ceratosaurus nasicornis (UMNH VP 5278; MWC 1), Majungasaurus crenatissimus (FMNH PR 2100, 2278), Marshosaurus bicentesimus (UMNH VP 7824, 7825; CMNH 21704), Megalosaurus bucklandii (BMNH R.8303; OUMNH J13506, 13559), Allosaurus fragilis (AMNH 600, 851; BYU-VP 2008; UMNH VP 5393, 9168, USNM 8335) and Tyrannosaurus rex (CMNH 9380; FMNH PR 2081; BHI 3033) all show similar ventral extension of the interdental plates. On the other hand, the two species of Carcharodontosaurus, C. saharicus (SGM Din–1) and C. iguidensis (MNN IGU2) can be differentiated on this aspect as the interdental plates of the former extend more ventral than the latter (pers. obs.). Based on this observation, the ventral extension of the interdental plate relative to the lateral wall may genuinely variate interspecifically and this feature is therefore considered to be a synapomorphical character differentiating the two species of Torvosaurus. To our knowledge, the presence of an interdental wall coincidental with the lateral wall of the maxillary body is an autapomorphical feature of T. gurneyi among Megalosauroidea.",,,,,,,,,,,

The strict consensus is well-resolved. Although basal pistosaurians form a polytomy, this results from the uncertain phylogenetic position of the skull of Pistosaurus. When Pistosaurus is pruned from the set of most parsimonious cladograms, Bobosaurus and Augustasaurus are resolved as successive outgroups to Plesiosauria (). A surprising, novel topology is recovered, in which Pliosauridae and Plesiosauroidea form a clade (Neoplesiosauria sensu Ketchum &amp; Benson ) excluding Rhomaleosauridae. Many previous classifications, and all phylogenetic analyses have united Pliosauridae with rhomaleosaurids in a monophyletic ‘Pliosauroidea’, sometimes also including Cretaceous clades such as Polycotylidae (e.g. , , , , ). Neoplesiosauria receives only moderate branch support here (decay index = 2). However, it is supported by 12 synapomorphies, of which seven are unambiguously optimised: the presence of a short posteroventral process of the postorbital (character 35.2), a mediolaterally narrow parietal vault, lacking the ‘lateral angle’ (38.0), posteromedian ridge of the supraoccipital absent (58.1), parasphenoid terminates within the anterior one-third of the posterior interpterygoid vacuity forming diamond-shaped ventral platform (64.0), surangular transversely narrow and ‘blade-like’, lacking a prominent medial crest and dorsomedial fossa (99.2), distal anteroposterior width of scapular blade subequal to width at midlength (161.0; not expanded), humeral shaft has pronounced dorsodistal curvature (185.0). Strong character support for Neoplesiosauria contrasts with a previously-hypothesised ‘Pliosauroidea’, comprising Pliosauridae and Rhomaleosauridae, most proposed synapomorphies of which are actually plesiomorphies . NHMUK 49202 was found basal to Rhomaleosauridae on the phylogenetic ‘stem’ leading to Neoplesiosauria as in Ketchum &amp; Benson (2010 ). It possesses several plesiomorphies not found in more derived plesiosaurians, including: the premaxilla does not divide the anterior processes of the frontals (14.0); the occipital condyle lacks a constricting groove around its base, even ventrally (49.2); and the paraoccipital process is inclined dorsolaterally relative to the ventral surface of the exoccipital-opisthotic, resulting in a narrow cranioquadrate passage (54.1).",,,,,,,,,,,

They show that the advent of plesiosaurian locomotion was followed by a gradual increase in body size spanning approximately 17 million years between the Triassic–Jurassic boundary and the lower Toarcian. Thus, the largest lower Toarcian plesiosaurian, Rhomaleosaurus thorntoni, has a trunk almost twice as long as ‘Rhomaleosaurus’ megacephalus from the lower Jurassic fauna (). If linear dimensions scale isometrically in rhomaleosaurids, this implies an eight-fold increase in body mass (this is inexact, but provides an estimate of the order of magnitude of the change). This trend of increasing maximum body size continued in later plesiosaurian evolution; the largest pliosaurids, known from fragmentary Late Jurassic remains, were substantially larger than R. thorntoni. For example, ‘Stretosaurus’ ( = Pliosaurus) macromerus has a humeral length of 840 mm and femoral length of 960 mm , compared to 720 mm and 680 mm in R. thorntoni (NHMUK R4853). Minimum body size also increased through the Lower Jurassic, though less prominently (). Seeleyosaurus, the smallest Toarcian plesiosaurian, has a trunk length 1.32 times that of Thalassiodracon, the smallest plesiosaurian from the lowermost Jurassic. It is noteworthy that small-bodied individuals and taxa (Thalassiodracon, Avalonnectes, Stratesaurus) are abundant in the earliest Jurassic fauna, but rarer in the Toarcian (). However, analyses of ln-transformed trunk length data suggest that the pattern of body size increase in early plesiosaurian evolution cannot be distinguished from a Brownian motion, or ‘passive expansion’ model (). This is similar to the pattern observed in Mesozoic birds , and during early dinosaur evolution , suggesting that driven trends of body size change (‘Cope's Rule’) do not always occur during Mesozoic ecological radiations.",,,,,,,,,,,

The two pieces are separated by sizeable lengths of maxillae and premaxillae in the upper jaw and similar lengths of mandibular rami, but the exact lengths of these missing portions are unknown. No other I. latidens fossils have provided a complete jaw for comparison, although another set of jaws is known: UMZC T706/R392 (accessioned in University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge, and possibly representing the lost jaws of the I. latidens holotype ). This material is badly crushed and the posterior skull remains – including the jaw joint or other hallmarks of the braincase region – are missing (MPW, pers. obs. 2007). Although more of the maxilla and mandible length are preserved in this specimen than BMNH R3877, the distortion of the skull renders it of questionable use in reconstructing the skull proportions of I. latidens and, at best, it only gives a minimum length of the jaws.",,,,,,,,,,,

A full inventory of NHMUK R3877 is provided by both Hooley  and Howse et al. . The piece under scrutiny in this paper, comprising a slender bar of right maxilla and a tomial portion of right dentary, was figured by Hooley (, Plate XXXVIII, ) and associated with a (misidentified) maxillonasal bar. The ‘maxillonasal bar’ is no longer associated with the maxilla and dentary fragments but may still be found in the NHMUK collections. Hooley identified both the maxilla and dentary in this piece but was unable to, or otherwise did not, link them with the larger skull remains in either his skull length estimates or skull reconstruction. The separation of the ‘maxillonasal bar’ from these jaw fragments, presumably postdating Hooley’s illustration, may indicate that additional preparation of the specimen has taken place since Hooley’s work (one referee noted its absence from Arthaber’s I. latidens skull 1919 reconstruction [], suggesting it may have been removed shortly after the publication of Hooley’s monograph) and, possibly, permit modern workers to associate the skull components in a fashion denied to Hooley. In any case, the broken ends of the maxilla, and anterior end of the dentary, are very close morphological matches to the corresponding breaks on the major skull pieces of NHMUK R3877, with the dimensions (maxillae of 6–7 mm deep the broken ends of both the larger skull elements and medial jaw pieces), size of the medial grove (see description, below), approximate fracture profiles and mandibular displacement relative to the maxilla corroborating well across all pieces. This suggests very small quantities, perhaps only millimetres, of the jaw length have been lost. The continuity of these elements was corroborated by several witnesses during a visit to NHMUK in June of 2011. Additional, independent investigation of these elements by others corroborates the continuity of these pieces (Martill, Vidovic, Davies and O’Sullivan, pers. comm. 2011).",,,,,,,,,,,

Although the amount of missing material remains unknown, the close morphological correspondence of the broken jaw elements suggests there is little reason to assume the skull was considerably longer than this measurement. This challenges Hooley’s assumption that the skull was continuous when deposited, a challenge supported by clear indications of pre-depositional damage to the NHMUK R3877 rostrum (). Hooley did not record any damage to the rostral portion of NHMUK R3877, but both lateral surfaces show large fractures and cracks, with the right demonstrating obvious ventral displacement of the posterior rostrum. The dorsal surface is also highly fractured with a discontinuous dorsal margin discernible in lateral view (). This damage has displaced the entire posterior region of the rostrum, including the posterodorsal process of the premaxilla and maxillary bar.

This is consistent with the high-energy conditions predicted for deposition within a bed-scouring gutter cast. Thus, Hooley’s  assumption that the skull was continuous when deposited is unlikely, which casts doubt on the reliability of his skull length estimate. Note that the crushing and ventral displacement of the posterior rostrum means the angles between the two principal skull pieces cannot be used to reconstruct the skull reliably (indeed, the author failed to reproduce Hooley’s length estimate using this method). Incorporating the mid-length jaw elements into the skull reconstruction seems a far more parsimonious manner of reconstructing the skull and does not risk, unlike Hooley’s method, overestimating the skull length. It is also worth stressing that Hooley’s method of estimating the missing lengths of NHMUK R3877 cannot be tested now that the specimen has been extensively prepared.",,,,,,,,,,,

The total preserved skull length now measures 431 mm, suggesting the entire skull was not much longer than 450 mm. This is a far cry from the estimated 560 mm skull length previously ascribed to this species and, if correct, suggests its jaws were unusually short for a pterodactyloid, occupying less than 80 percent of the preserved skull length. The upper toothrow now occupies 25 percent of the upper jaw and 27 percent of the lower, compared to less than 20 percent in Hooley’s consideration. The posterior skull is strikingly tall compared to other istiodactylids in measuring, from its tallest point to the line of the jaw, 38 percent of the jaw length. Accordingly, the posterodorsal extension of the premaxilla must have been dorsally deflected from the rostrum to connect with the posterior skull elements (as in ), which may have been possible given the damage to the posterior rostrum of the specimen and the slight dorsal curve in the dorsal rostral margin (). The maxilla is extremely gracile in comparison to the posterodorsal bar of the premaxilla, being almost 50 percent shallower in lateral view. Hooley  noted that NHMUK R3877 has a large projected skull width across the quadrates: mirroring the preserved skull along its midline suggests a width of c. 100 mm. Coupled with proposed jaw length estimate, this suggests I. latidens had a proportionally short, wide jaw with a length:width ratio of at least 0.3, a number unsurpassed in long-jawed pterodactyloids  and only exceeded by the short-faced pterosaur Tapejara wellnhoferi",,,,,,,,,,,

Note that the width of the jaws of NHMUK R3877 can be estimated with some confidence: the posterior skull bears none of the fracturing or crushing-induced distortion seen in the rostrum, and the rest of the NHMUK R3877 specimen is well-enough preserved that the bones articulate very well. The likelihood of the posterior skull alone being plastically distorted while the other elements are unaffected is very low. Enough of the dorsal region is preserved to reconstruct the skull apex, so a line of symmetry can be determined and the width of the skull at the quadrates estimated.

Nor does it seem likely that the oblique crushing affecting the I. sinensis skull can account for the pronounced proportional differences between these specimens. Accordingly, it must be assumed that these differences reflect taxonomic distinctions, bringing into question whether the two currently recognised Istiodactylus species are congeneric. Many well-established pterosaur genera are characterised by far subtler characters of their skulls than those identified between I. latidens and I. sinensis here (e.g. -) and a case could be made for splitting Istiodactylus into two, monospecific genera. The interrelationships of Istiodactylidae are not clear, however, and splitting Istiodactylus may unnecessarily complicate their taxonomy.

The orbits of Istiodactylus are proportionally small compared to those of presumed predatory pterosaurs (such as the closely related ornithocheirids): if pterosaur orbit size correlates with some aspects of visual acuity as it does in modern raptors (see above), this may indicate a reduced need to find hidden prey. Istiodactylids were probably powerful fliers, as evidenced by distally warped deltopectoral crests and deep sterna that enlarge the area for downstroke musculature attachment (see , Plate XXXIX, , Plate XL, , ; also ). The importance of flight to scavenging birds cannot be overstated: their success as obligate scavengers is strongly linked to their ability to find, travel to, and consume carcasses before terrestrial carnivores . The detailed flight performance of istiodactylids remains uninvestigated, but the wing ecomorphology of Nurhachius has been compared to modern soaring birds in principle component analysis and may have been suited to the low-energy soaring required to search for and reach carrion . There is also some indication that istiodactylids were better suited for terrestrial launches, like modern vultures, than the aquatic launches that other members of Ornithocheiroidea seem well adapted to . While istiodactylids possess the ‘warped’ deltopectoral crests linked to aquatic launching in some pterosaurs , they are not elongated along the diaphysis, suggesting their forelimb adductor musculature was not as large as those of water-launching ornithocheiroids. In addition, the istiodactylid scapulocoracoid is somewhat more gracile than those of ornithocheiroids, perhaps corroborating the idea of relatively slight flight musculature in istiodactylids compared to their close relatives. The sedimentological context of the istiodactylid fossil record agrees with their scavenging in terrestrial settings by being strongly skewed towards freshwater deposits (e.g. [12,48v49]), or brackish sediments with strong terrestrial input . There therefore seems a rich ground for enquiry into the possibility of scavenging habits in istiodactylids and, in addition to further reappraisal of NHMUK R3877, this may prove a worthwhile avenue of future research.",,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous lines of osteological evidence suggest that hadrosaurs used their forelimbs for weight-bearing, and could not have utilized them for grasping. The proximal ulna of hadrosaurs bears an anterolateral process (e.g., Corythosaurus ROM 1947, Edmontosaurus ROM 801; Brachylophosaurus CMN [Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Canada] 8893; –), a feature that is also present in all other quadrupedal ornithischians (ceratopsids, stegosaurs and ankylosaurs) and quadrupedal sauropodomorphs . This means that the radius articulates with the ulna anteromedially at the proximal end. Distally, the radius is also located medial to the ulna, indicated by a concave, cup-like facet medially on the ulna (Brachylophosaurus CMN 8893; Lambeosaurus ROM 1218; ), and a facet laterally on the radius (Brachlophosaurus CMN 8893). This condition contrasts with that in basal dinosaurs  and bipedal ornithischians, where the radius was located anterior to the ulna (e.g., Dysalotosaurus MB [Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany] R.1408; Hypsilophodon NHMUK R196), causing the manus to be supinated when articulated; a feature presumably required for manual manipulation of food and grasping. Medial movement of the radius in hadrosaurs and other quadrupedal ornithischians would have resulted in pronation of the manus, which is required for quadrupedal locomotion . The morphology of the distal articular facets of the ulna and radius in hadrosaurs precludes rotation of the distal end of the radius around the ulna, so that supination of the manus would have been impossible .",,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, only the sacra of AMNH 5245, NHMUK R5161, and ROM 1930 can be observed in ventral view, as all of the other pelves are mounted for display with only the dorsal surface accessible. A full description of the pelvis of specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus is provided by Coombs . Vickaryous et al. (2004) and Thompson et al. , only noted the presence or absence of the synsacrum, but did not fully describe it. Where sacral vertebrae are preserved, they are always coossified, except for AMNH 5266, a juvenile specimen . The number of dorsosacrals and caudosacrals is variable. True sacrals are identified here as those that immediately bracket the acetabulum, and in all referred specimens there appear to have been no more than three. AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 each have four dorsosacrals, three sacrals, and one caudosacral. AMNH 5245 has two dorsosacrals, three sacrals, and one caudosacral, but the anterior end of the sacrum is broken and there were almost certainly additional dorsosacrals. The sacrum of ROM 1930 is in several pieces, but includes a block of five coossified vertebrae (with a sixth broken off), which appear to be dorsosacrals based on the flattened, T-shaped ribs (). The most anterior vertebra in this section has free, unfused prezygapophyses, which indicates that this is the first vertebra in the fused sacral rod. The most posterior vertebra preserved in this section may be a sacral vertebra. A second section of fused vertebrae consists of two vertebrae that are most likely sacral vertebrae, based on the morphology of the centra and the large broken area representing the attachments of the sacral ribs. These two sections do not fit back together, so it is unclear if an additional vertebra is missing between them. In total, at least seven dorsosacral and sacral vertebrae formed the sacral rod of ROM 1930. There are an additional three unfused caudosacral vertebrae in ROM 1930 ( G–J). The distal ends of the transverse processes are large, not tapering, which suggests they contacted or fused with the ilia. This specimen also has three loose vertebrae, one of which is probably a true sacral, and two of which are probably caudosacrals. ROM 1930 may have had up to eleven vertebrae in the pelvis. NHMUK R5161 includes at least three dorsosacrals, three sacrals and three caudosacrals (see :Pl. VI, ).

The neural spines of all of the vertebrae of the sacrum fuse into a single continuous sheet of bone, such that the prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses become indistinct. In TMP 1982.9.3, the distal ends of the neural spines are laterally expanded, forming a flat to slightly concave dorsal surface (). Although the neural spines are completely coossifed in ROM 1930, in dorsal view the individual neural spines form a repeating teardrop pattern (). This region is unprepared in AMNH 5245, somewhat reconstructed with plaster in both AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409, and obscured by skin impressions in NHMUK R5161. The centra of the dorsosacrals have lateral surfaces that are slightly more concave compared to the centra of the sacrals.

Nopcsa  gave the location for NHMUK R5161 as one half mile below Happy Jack ferry on the Red Deer River, about halfway up a 400-foot-deep canyon; this information was passed on to Nopcsa from F. A. Bather (NHMUK), who had received this information from W. Parks (ROM), who in turn had received this information from L. Sternberg. W. E. Cutler, who had originally discovered NHMUK R5161, was badly injured during its excavation , and so either one or several members of the Sternberg family finished the excavation. The quarry location was marked on the Steveville topographic map , but frequent attempts to find the quarry between 1967 and 2007 failed to find a quarry stake. When this locality was visited in 2007, the quarry stake was found downstream and down-section from where it had been marked on the map. Furthermore, it was posted at an angle at the top of a vertical wall, which makes it unlikely that this represents the quarry for NHMUK R5161 (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). GPS coordinates for this quarry stake provided by Currie and Russell  were taken from the map position. No photographs of the quarry are known in either museum collections or archives. However, a potential quarry has been located a short distance away from where the original quarry stake was found in 2007, and the skyline matches that in a poor photograph of the quarry that was published in a magazine (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). Unfortunately, no definitive evidence such as newspaper scraps with dates (used to identify ‘lost’ quarries ), or ankylosaurid elements, have been recovered, and there is some ambiguity regarding whether or not this quarry lies within the lowest Dinosaur Park Formation or the Oldman Formation (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). Additional fieldwork and research is required to verify the geographic and stratigraphic position of NHMUK R5161.

The holotype of Scolosaurus cutleri (NHMUK R5161) is one of the most complete ankylosaurs ever collected, preserving nearly the entire skeleton as well as in situ osteoderms and skin impressions. However, it is challenging to compare this specimen with other specimens for several reasons. First, it lacks a skull and tail club, which contain important taxonomic information. Second, although the in situ osteoderms and skin impressions provide important information on the integument of ankylosaurs, they also obscure certain skeletal elements such as the scapula and pelvis. Third, the specimen is currently on display tipped onto its right side, in a relatively dark area, in a glass cabinet that cannot be easily opened, which makes detailed examination of the specimen difficult, especially the anterior and left side of the animal. Nevertheless, it is possible to assess the taxonomic status of NHMUK R5161 as it preserves the first cervical half ring, and thus can be compared to both Anodontosaurus lambei and Euoplocephalus tutus.",,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, NHMUK R5161 does not preserve any low-keeled oval osteoderms or steeply pitched triangular osteoderms, two morphologies that were found associated with the holotype skull of MOR 433 (see : ). In MPC 100/1305, a Mongolian ankylosaurid that preserves numerous in situ osteoderms, low-keeled oval osteoderms with off-centre keels are found only on the lateral sides of the trunk, and steeply pitched triangular osteoderms are found only on the lateral sides of the pelvis and tail. Low-keeled osteoderms are found on the dorsal side of the trunk and tail (see ). Although NHMUK R5161 preserves most of the dorsal integument, it does not preserve osteoderms on the flanks or lateral sides of the tail, and so it is conceivable that the absence of the unique MOR 433 osteoderm morphologies in NHMUK R5161 is a preservational artifact. The length of the transverse processes relative to the width of the centrum varies along the caudal vertebral column in ankylosaurids, with transverse processes decreasing in size posteriorly.

AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 differ from NHMUK R5161 (Scolosaurus) in the relative length of the postacetabular process of the ilium. AMNH 5337 includes a skull that is generally similar to that of UALVP 31, but does have some notable differences. In particular, the squamosal horns of AMNH 5337 are much shorter and more rounded, and the cranial caputegulae are less distinct, compared to those of UALVP 31 (, ). Coombs  noted that smaller skulls had more prominent and pointed squamosal and quadratojugal horns compared to larger skulls. Penkalski , in a morphometric analysis of referred Euoplocephalus tutus skulls, found that squamosal horn height decreased with increasing skull size. He also reported a positive correlation between skull size and rugosity of osteoderm sculpturing. If squamosal horn length and bluntness, and cranial caputegulum distinctness, are related to size, then they are probably a result of ontogenetic changes. Horner and Goodwin , in a discussion of ontogeny in the pachycephalosaurids Dracorex, Stygimoloch, and Pachycephalosaurus, suggested that the pyramidal nodes on the nasals and the squamosal horns of these taxa decreased in size and became more rounded through ontogeny. Scannella and Horner  also suggested that the epoccipitals of Triceratops become lower, and less distinct from the frill throughout ontogeny. It is possible that cranial ornamentation in Euoplocephalus tutus followed a similar trajectory as that observed for Pachycephalosaurus and Triceratops, with the squamosal horns being resorbed and the cranial sculpturing becoming less distinct. UALVP 31 appears to have resorption pits on the squamosal horns, which would support this hypothesis (). Penkalski and Blows  state that none of the referred Euoplocephalus specimens, except for AMNH 5266 (herein considered Anodontosaurus) represented young juveniles. The ontogenetic stage of a dinosaur is best assessed using histological sections, and no studies have been published on histological sections of ankylosaur long bones for the purpose of determining ontogenetic stage. As such, it is not currently possible to confidently determine the relative ontogenetic stages of ankylosaurs, let alone specimens previously referred to Euoplocephalus. Histological sampling and analysis is required in order to test the hypothesis that changes in cranial ornamentation in Euoplocephalus are related to ontogeny.",,,,,,,,,,,

This specimen was referred to Euoplocephalus tutus by Penkalski . However, there are few features that allow it to be confidently assigned to Ankylosauridae, let alone to a particular genus or species. The straight shaft of the broken ischium, and the rugose, thin-walled osteoderms suggest that ROM 813 is an ankylosaurid rather than a nodosaurid. ROM 813 has rectangular, keeled osteoderms, unlike those present in NHMUK R5161; and because NHMUK R5161 preserves nearly the entire dorsal integument it is unlikely that ROM 813 is referable to Scolosaurus cutleri. ROM 813 is from the lowest levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation and as such is unlikely to be referable to Anodontosaurus lambei. It does not have any triangular osteoderms such as those present on the tail of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, but it is unclear if any of the preserved integument in ROM 813 is from the tail. At present, it is impossible to determine if ROM 813 is referable to Dyoplosaurus or Euoplocephalus. This unsatisfactory result can only be resolved by finding additional specimens with in situ integument.",,,,,,,,,,,

In the rhynchosaur Stenaulorhynchus (NHMUK R36618) the lateral surfaces of the centra are gently waisted (a feature common among tetrapods: see ) and there are very shallow depressions beneath the transverse processes in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae. However, vertebral laminae, distinct fossae, foramina, and other possible indicators of pneumaticity are absent (). CT sections () show that the interior is composed of densely packed trabecular bone with no large spaces. Evidence of pneumaticity is therefore absent in Stenaulorhynchus, and potentially pneumatic features have not been reported in other rhynchosaurs , . The “deep pockets” present on the vertebrae of Howesia therefore appear to be unique among rhynchosaurs, and were considered diagnostic for this taxon by Dilkes .

The rostral and ventral margins of the dentary are parallel; as far as can be ascertained, the dentary does not appear to taper or deepen rostrally. Although the rostral ramus is incomplete, the curvature of the ventral margin implies that the rostral ramus was ventrally inflected, though to what degree relative to other basal iguanodonts is impossible to tell. The dentary tooth row is straight along its dorsal margin in lateral view (). In dorsolateral view, the tooth row is straight for much of its length but curves laterally near its caudal end and merges with the base of the coronoid process (). The coronoid process of UMNH VP 20208 is overlain by the left jugal, and thus its morphology and orientation are nebulous. The dentary tooth row has a very pronounced medial offset relative to the lateral surface of the dentary due to a broad shelf lateral to the tooth row that extends from the rostral-most preserved portion of the dentary to the base of the coronoid process (). This shelf is strongly convex along its dorsolateral margin, becoming gently concave as it slopes medially towards the tooth row. This shelf is unique to UMNH VP 20208 and is an autapomorphy of Hippodraco scutodens. In other basal iguanodonts, such as Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis (NHMUK R5764) and the otherwise similar Theiophytalia kerri (YPM 1887), the lateral surface of the dentary is gently convex from the ventral to the dorsal margin; there is medial offset of the tooth row, but it is not as pronounced as in Hippodraco nor is there a broad shelf lateral to the tooth row. The dentary of UMNH VP 20208 does not appear to be pathological, nor is it likely that the dentary shelf is a product of plastic deformation; that the dorsal surface of the skull roof is visible in lateral view indicates that the skull was flattened by compression operating in a mediolateral direction. If the dentary had been crushed in the same fashion, it would be expected to have flattened out like the rest of the skull rather than to have curled over on itself to form a lateral shelf.

The strict consensus is well-resolved. Although basal pistosaurians form a polytomy, this results from the uncertain phylogenetic position of the skull of Pistosaurus. When Pistosaurus is pruned from the set of most parsimonious cladograms, Bobosaurus and Augustasaurus are resolved as successive outgroups to Plesiosauria (). A surprising, novel topology is recovered, in which Pliosauridae and Plesiosauroidea form a clade (Neoplesiosauria sensu Ketchum &amp; Benson ) excluding Rhomaleosauridae. Many previous classifications, and all phylogenetic analyses have united Pliosauridae with rhomaleosaurids in a monophyletic ‘Pliosauroidea’, sometimes also including Cretaceous clades such as Polycotylidae (e.g. , , , , ). Neoplesiosauria receives only moderate branch support here (decay index = 2). However, it is supported by 12 synapomorphies, of which seven are unambiguously optimised: the presence of a short posteroventral process of the postorbital (character 35.2), a mediolaterally narrow parietal vault, lacking the ‘lateral angle’ (38.0), posteromedian ridge of the supraoccipital absent (58.1), parasphenoid terminates within the anterior one-third of the posterior interpterygoid vacuity forming diamond-shaped ventral platform (64.0), surangular transversely narrow and ‘blade-like’, lacking a prominent medial crest and dorsomedial fossa (99.2), distal anteroposterior width of scapular blade subequal to width at midlength (161.0; not expanded), humeral shaft has pronounced dorsodistal curvature (185.0). Strong character support for Neoplesiosauria contrasts with a previously-hypothesised ‘Pliosauroidea’, comprising Pliosauridae and Rhomaleosauridae, most proposed synapomorphies of which are actually plesiomorphies . NHMUK 49202 was found basal to Rhomaleosauridae on the phylogenetic ‘stem’ leading to Neoplesiosauria as in Ketchum &amp; Benson (2010 ). It possesses several plesiomorphies not found in more derived plesiosaurians, including: the premaxilla does not divide the anterior processes of the frontals (14.0); the occipital condyle lacks a constricting groove around its base, even ventrally (49.2); and the paraoccipital process is inclined dorsolaterally relative to the ventral surface of the exoccipital-opisthotic, resulting in a narrow cranioquadrate passage (54.1).",,,,,,,,,,,

They show that the advent of plesiosaurian locomotion was followed by a gradual increase in body size spanning approximately 17 million years between the Triassic–Jurassic boundary and the lower Toarcian. Thus, the largest lower Toarcian plesiosaurian, Rhomaleosaurus thorntoni, has a trunk almost twice as long as ‘Rhomaleosaurus’ megacephalus from the lower Jurassic fauna (). If linear dimensions scale isometrically in rhomaleosaurids, this implies an eight-fold increase in body mass (this is inexact, but provides an estimate of the order of magnitude of the change). This trend of increasing maximum body size continued in later plesiosaurian evolution; the largest pliosaurids, known from fragmentary Late Jurassic remains, were substantially larger than R. thorntoni. For example, ‘Stretosaurus’ ( = Pliosaurus) macromerus has a humeral length of 840 mm and femoral length of 960 mm , compared to 720 mm and 680 mm in R. thorntoni (NHMUK R4853). Minimum body size also increased through the Lower Jurassic, though less prominently (). Seeleyosaurus, the smallest Toarcian plesiosaurian, has a trunk length 1.32 times that of Thalassiodracon, the smallest plesiosaurian from the lowermost Jurassic. It is noteworthy that small-bodied individuals and taxa (Thalassiodracon, Avalonnectes, Stratesaurus) are abundant in the earliest Jurassic fauna, but rarer in the Toarcian (). However, analyses of ln-transformed trunk length data suggest that the pattern of body size increase in early plesiosaurian evolution cannot be distinguished from a Brownian motion, or ‘passive expansion’ model (). This is similar to the pattern observed in Mesozoic birds , and during early dinosaur evolution , suggesting that driven trends of body size change (‘Cope's Rule’) do not always occur during Mesozoic ecological radiations.",,,,,,,,,,,

The skull of this individual is incompletely known, however. The middle length of the jaws, occipital aspect and much of the mandible have broken away, leading most authors to conclude that the NHMUK R3877 skull is primarily represented by two, non-articulating pieces (e.g. , , -). The posterior component reveals a relatively tall orbital region, preserving most of a reclined, partially closed and slender orbit; the posterior region of a large nasoantorbital fenestra that, unusually, extends beyond the jaw joint and a fragment of the articulated posterior mandible. The anterior piece, which also includes the complete mandibular symphysis, contains the anterior end of the nasoantorbital fenestra, the entire dental series and a particularly low, crestless rostrum. The two pieces are separated by sizeable lengths of maxillae and premaxillae in the upper jaw and similar lengths of mandibular rami, but the exact lengths of these missing portions are unknown. No other I. latidens fossils have provided a complete jaw for comparison, although another set of jaws is known: UMZC T706/R392 (accessioned in University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge, and possibly representing the lost jaws of the I. latidens holotype ). This material is badly crushed and the posterior skull remains – including the jaw joint or other hallmarks of the braincase region – are missing (MPW, pers. obs. 2007). Although more of the maxilla and mandible length are preserved in this specimen than BMNH R3877, the distortion of the skull renders it of questionable use in reconstructing the skull proportions of I. latidens and, at best, it only gives a minimum length of the jaws.","Indonesia","NHMUK 20050660","DQ974673","DQ927230",,,,,,,

A full inventory of NHMUK R3877 is provided by both Hooley  and Howse et al. . The piece under scrutiny in this paper, comprising a slender bar of right maxilla and a tomial portion of right dentary, was figured by Hooley (, Plate XXXVIII, ) and associated with a (misidentified) maxillonasal bar. The ‘maxillonasal bar’ is no longer associated with the maxilla and dentary fragments but may still be found in the NHMUK collections. Hooley identified both the maxilla and dentary in this piece but was unable to, or otherwise did not, link them with the larger skull remains in either his skull length estimates or skull reconstruction. The separation of the ‘maxillonasal bar’ from these jaw fragments, presumably postdating Hooley’s illustration, may indicate that additional preparation of the specimen has taken place since Hooley’s work (one referee noted its absence from Arthaber’s I. latidens skull 1919 reconstruction [], suggesting it may have been removed shortly after the publication of Hooley’s monograph) and, possibly, permit modern workers to associate the skull components in a fashion denied to Hooley. In any case, the broken ends of the maxilla, and anterior end of the dentary, are very close morphological matches to the corresponding breaks on the major skull pieces of NHMUK R3877, with the dimensions (maxillae of 6–7 mm deep the broken ends of both the larger skull elements and medial jaw pieces), size of the medial grove (see description, below), approximate fracture profiles and mandibular displacement relative to the maxilla corroborating well across all pieces. This suggests very small quantities, perhaps only millimetres, of the jaw length have been lost. The continuity of these elements was corroborated by several witnesses during a visit to NHMUK in June of 2011. Additional, independent investigation of these elements by others corroborates the continuity of these pieces (Martill, Vidovic, Davies and O’Sullivan, pers. comm. 2011).","South Africa","NHMUK 20070186","KF615825","KF615784",,,,,,,

This challenges Hooley’s assumption that the skull was continuous when deposited, a challenge supported by clear indications of pre-depositional damage to the NHMUK R3877 rostrum (). Hooley did not record any damage to the rostral portion of NHMUK R3877, but both lateral surfaces show large fractures and cracks, with the right demonstrating obvious ventral displacement of the posterior rostrum.

This is consistent with the high-energy conditions predicted for deposition within a bed-scouring gutter cast. Thus, Hooley’s  assumption that the skull was continuous when deposited is unlikely, which casts doubt on the reliability of his skull length estimate. Note that the crushing and ventral displacement of the posterior rostrum means the angles between the two principal skull pieces cannot be used to reconstruct the skull reliably (indeed, the author failed to reproduce Hooley’s length estimate using this method). Incorporating the mid-length jaw elements into the skull reconstruction seems a far more parsimonious manner of reconstructing the skull and does not risk, unlike Hooley’s method, overestimating the skull length. It is also worth stressing that Hooley’s method of estimating the missing lengths of NHMUK R3877 cannot be tested now that the specimen has been extensively prepared.","Portugal","NHMUK 20070018","KF615838","KF615804",,,,,,,

The total preserved skull length now measures 431 mm, suggesting the entire skull was not much longer than 450 mm. This is a far cry from the estimated 560 mm skull length previously ascribed to this species and, if correct, suggests its jaws were unusually short for a pterodactyloid, occupying less than 80 percent of the preserved skull length. The upper toothrow now occupies 25 percent of the upper jaw and 27 percent of the lower, compared to less than 20 percent in Hooley’s consideration. The posterior skull is strikingly tall compared to other istiodactylids in measuring, from its tallest point to the line of the jaw, 38 percent of the jaw length. Accordingly, the posterodorsal extension of the premaxilla must have been dorsally deflected from the rostrum to connect with the posterior skull elements (as in ), which may have been possible given the damage to the posterior rostrum of the specimen and the slight dorsal curve in the dorsal rostral margin (). The maxilla is extremely gracile in comparison to the posterodorsal bar of the premaxilla, being almost 50 percent shallower in lateral view. Hooley  noted that NHMUK R3877 has a large projected skull width across the quadrates: mirroring the preserved skull along its midline suggests a width of c. 100 mm. Coupled with proposed jaw length estimate, this suggests I. latidens had a proportionally short, wide jaw with a length:width ratio of at least 0.3, a number unsurpassed in long-jawed pterodactyloids  and only exceeded by the short-faced pterosaur Tapejara wellnhoferi",,,,,,,,,,,

The likelihood of the posterior skull alone being plastically distorted while the other elements are unaffected is very low. Enough of the dorsal region is preserved to reconstruct the skull apex, so a line of symmetry can be determined and the width of the skull at the quadrates estimated.

Nor does it seem likely that the oblique crushing affecting the I. sinensis skull can account for the pronounced proportional differences between these specimens. Accordingly, it must be assumed that these differences reflect taxonomic distinctions, bringing into question whether the two currently recognised Istiodactylus species are congeneric. Many well-established pterosaur genera are characterised by far subtler characters of their skulls than those identified between I. latidens and I. sinensis here (e.g. -) and a case could be made for splitting Istiodactylus into two, monospecific genera.

The orbits of Istiodactylus are proportionally small compared to those of presumed predatory pterosaurs (such as the closely related ornithocheirids): if pterosaur orbit size correlates with some aspects of visual acuity as it does in modern raptors (see above), this may indicate a reduced need to find hidden prey. Istiodactylids were probably powerful fliers, as evidenced by distally warped deltopectoral crests and deep sterna that enlarge the area for downstroke musculature attachment (see , Plate XXXIX, , Plate XL, , ; also ). The importance of flight to scavenging birds cannot be overstated: their success as obligate scavengers is strongly linked to their ability to find, travel to, and consume carcasses before terrestrial carnivores . The detailed flight performance of istiodactylids remains uninvestigated, but the wing ecomorphology of Nurhachius has been compared to modern soaring birds in principle component analysis and may have been suited to the low-energy soaring required to search for and reach carrion . There is also some indication that istiodactylids were better suited for terrestrial launches, like modern vultures, than the aquatic launches that other members of Ornithocheiroidea seem well adapted to . While istiodactylids possess the ‘warped’ deltopectoral crests linked to aquatic launching in some pterosaurs , they are not elongated along the diaphysis, suggesting their forelimb adductor musculature was not as large as those of water-launching ornithocheiroids. In addition, the istiodactylid scapulocoracoid is somewhat more gracile than those of ornithocheiroids, perhaps corroborating the idea of relatively slight flight musculature in istiodactylids compared to their close relatives. The sedimentological context of the istiodactylid fossil record agrees with their scavenging in terrestrial settings by being strongly skewed towards freshwater deposits (e.g. [12,48v49]), or brackish sediments with strong terrestrial input . There therefore seems a rich ground for enquiry into the possibility of scavenging habits in istiodactylids and, in addition to further reappraisal of NHMUK R3877, this may prove a worthwhile avenue of future research.",,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous lines of osteological evidence suggest that hadrosaurs used their forelimbs for weight-bearing, and could not have utilized them for grasping. The proximal ulna of hadrosaurs bears an anterolateral process (e.g., Corythosaurus ROM 1947, Edmontosaurus ROM 801; Brachylophosaurus CMN [Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Canada] 8893; –), a feature that is also present in all other quadrupedal ornithischians (ceratopsids, stegosaurs and ankylosaurs) and quadrupedal sauropodomorphs . This means that the radius articulates with the ulna anteromedially at the proximal end. Distally, the radius is also located medial to the ulna, indicated by a concave, cup-like facet medially on the ulna (Brachylophosaurus CMN 8893; Lambeosaurus ROM 1218; ), and a facet laterally on the radius (Brachlophosaurus CMN 8893). This condition contrasts with that in basal dinosaurs  and bipedal ornithischians, where the radius was located anterior to the ulna (e.g., Dysalotosaurus MB [Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany] R.1408; Hypsilophodon NHMUK R196), causing the manus to be supinated when articulated; a feature presumably required for manual manipulation of food and grasping. Medial movement of the radius in hadrosaurs and other quadrupedal ornithischians would have resulted in pronation of the manus, which is required for quadrupedal locomotion . The morphology of the distal articular facets of the ulna and radius in hadrosaurs precludes rotation of the distal end of the radius around the ulna, so that supination of the manus would have been impossible .","Portugal","NHMUK 20030296","KF615812","KF615777",,,,,,,

Currently, only the sacra of AMNH 5245, NHMUK R5161, and ROM 1930 can be observed in ventral view, as all of the other pelves are mounted for display with only the dorsal surface accessible. A full description of the pelvis of specimens referred to Euoplocephalus tutus is provided by Coombs . Vickaryous et al. (2004) and Thompson et al. , only noted the presence or absence of the synsacrum, but did not fully describe it. Where sacral vertebrae are preserved, they are always coossified, except for AMNH 5266, a juvenile specimen . The number of dorsosacrals and caudosacrals is variable. True sacrals are identified here as those that immediately bracket the acetabulum, and in all referred specimens there appear to have been no more than three. AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 each have four dorsosacrals, three sacrals, and one caudosacral. AMNH 5245 has two dorsosacrals, three sacrals, and one caudosacral, but the anterior end of the sacrum is broken and there were almost certainly additional dorsosacrals. The sacrum of ROM 1930 is in several pieces, but includes a block of five coossified vertebrae (with a sixth broken off), which appear to be dorsosacrals based on the flattened, T-shaped ribs (). The most anterior vertebra in this section has free, unfused prezygapophyses, which indicates that this is the first vertebra in the fused sacral rod. The most posterior vertebra preserved in this section may be a sacral vertebra. A second section of fused vertebrae consists of two vertebrae that are most likely sacral vertebrae, based on the morphology of the centra and the large broken area representing the attachments of the sacral ribs. These two sections do not fit back together, so it is unclear if an additional vertebra is missing between them. In total, at least seven dorsosacral and sacral vertebrae formed the sacral rod of ROM 1930. There are an additional three unfused caudosacral vertebrae in ROM 1930 ( G–J). The distal ends of the transverse processes are large, not tapering, which suggests they contacted or fused with the ilia. This specimen also has three loose vertebrae, one of which is probably a true sacral, and two of which are probably caudosacrals. ROM 1930 may have had up to eleven vertebrae in the pelvis. NHMUK R5161 includes at least three dorsosacrals, three sacrals and three caudosacrals (see :Pl. VI, ).

The neural spines of all of the vertebrae of the sacrum fuse into a single continuous sheet of bone, such that the prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses become indistinct. In TMP 1982.9.3, the distal ends of the neural spines are laterally expanded, forming a flat to slightly concave dorsal surface (). Although the neural spines are completely coossifed in ROM 1930, in dorsal view the individual neural spines form a repeating teardrop pattern (). This region is unprepared in AMNH 5245, somewhat reconstructed with plaster in both AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409, and obscured by skin impressions in NHMUK R5161. The centra of the dorsosacrals have lateral surfaces that are slightly more concave compared to the centra of the sacrals. Ventrally, the sacral vertebrae lack a midline groove (AMNH 5245) or have a shallow, discontinuous midline groove (ROM 1930).

Nopcsa  gave the location for NHMUK R5161 as one half mile below Happy Jack ferry on the Red Deer River, about halfway up a 400-foot-deep canyon; this information was passed on to Nopcsa from F. A. Bather (NHMUK), who had received this information from W. Parks (ROM), who in turn had received this information from L. Sternberg. W. E. Cutler, who had originally discovered NHMUK R5161, was badly injured during its excavation , and so either one or several members of the Sternberg family finished the excavation. The quarry location was marked on the Steveville topographic map , but frequent attempts to find the quarry between 1967 and 2007 failed to find a quarry stake. When this locality was visited in 2007, the quarry stake was found downstream and down-section from where it had been marked on the map. Furthermore, it was posted at an angle at the top of a vertical wall, which makes it unlikely that this represents the quarry for NHMUK R5161 (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). GPS coordinates for this quarry stake provided by Currie and Russell  were taken from the map position. No photographs of the quarry are known in either museum collections or archives. However, a potential quarry has been located a short distance away from where the original quarry stake was found in 2007, and the skyline matches that in a poor photograph of the quarry that was published in a magazine (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). Unfortunately, no definitive evidence such as newspaper scraps with dates (used to identify ‘lost’ quarries ), or ankylosaurid elements, have been recovered, and there is some ambiguity regarding whether or not this quarry lies within the lowest Dinosaur Park Formation or the Oldman Formation (Tanke pers. comm. 2013). Additional fieldwork and research is required to verify the geographic and stratigraphic position of NHMUK R5161.

The holotype of Scolosaurus cutleri (NHMUK R5161) is one of the most complete ankylosaurs ever collected, preserving nearly the entire skeleton as well as in situ osteoderms and skin impressions. However, it is challenging to compare this specimen with other specimens for several reasons. First, it lacks a skull and tail club, which contain important taxonomic information. Second, although the in situ osteoderms and skin impressions provide important information on the integument of ankylosaurs, they also obscure certain skeletal elements such as the scapula and pelvis. Third, the specimen is currently on display tipped onto its right side, in a relatively dark area, in a glass cabinet that cannot be easily opened, which makes detailed examination of the specimen difficult, especially the anterior and left side of the animal.

In MPC 100/1305, a Mongolian ankylosaurid that preserves numerous in situ osteoderms, low-keeled oval osteoderms with off-centre keels are found only on the lateral sides of the trunk, and steeply pitched triangular osteoderms are found only on the lateral sides of the pelvis and tail.

Although NHMUK R5161 preserves most of the dorsal integument, it does not preserve osteoderms on the flanks or lateral sides of the tail, and so it is conceivable that the absence of the unique MOR 433 osteoderm morphologies in NHMUK R5161 is a preservational artifact. The length of the transverse processes relative to the width of the centrum varies along the caudal vertebral column in ankylosaurids, with transverse processes decreasing in size posteriorly.

AMNH 5337 and AMNH 5409 differ from NHMUK R5161 (Scolosaurus) in the relative length of the postacetabular process of the ilium. AMNH 5337 includes a skull that is generally similar to that of UALVP 31, but does have some notable differences. In particular, the squamosal horns of AMNH 5337 are much shorter and more rounded, and the cranial caputegulae are less distinct, compared to those of UALVP 31 (, ). Coombs  noted that smaller skulls had more prominent and pointed squamosal and quadratojugal horns compared to larger skulls. Penkalski , in a morphometric analysis of referred Euoplocephalus tutus skulls, found that squamosal horn height decreased with increasing skull size. He also reported a positive correlation between skull size and rugosity of osteoderm sculpturing. If squamosal horn length and bluntness, and cranial caputegulum distinctness, are related to size, then they are probably a result of ontogenetic changes. Horner and Goodwin , in a discussion of ontogeny in the pachycephalosaurids Dracorex, Stygimoloch, and Pachycephalosaurus, suggested that the pyramidal nodes on the nasals and the squamosal horns of these taxa decreased in size and became more rounded through ontogeny. Scannella and Horner  also suggested that the epoccipitals of Triceratops become lower, and less distinct from the frill throughout ontogeny. It is possible that cranial ornamentation in Euoplocephalus tutus followed a similar trajectory as that observed for Pachycephalosaurus and Triceratops, with the squamosal horns being resorbed and the cranial sculpturing becoming less distinct. UALVP 31 appears to have resorption pits on the squamosal horns, which would support this hypothesis (). Penkalski and Blows  state that none of the referred Euoplocephalus specimens, except for AMNH 5266 (herein considered Anodontosaurus) represented young juveniles. The ontogenetic stage of a dinosaur is best assessed using histological sections, and no studies have been published on histological sections of ankylosaur long bones for the purpose of determining ontogenetic stage.

In particular, he indicated that radially ribbed, perforate, conical osteoderms only occur in ROM 1930 and NHMUK R5161 (∶270). Later in the same paper, he stated that AMNH 5337 has perforate osteoderms (: 287) and that most referred Euoplocephalus tutus osteoderms have some degree of ribbing or fluting (∶289). Penkalski and Blows  suggest that ROM 1930 might be referable to Scolosaurus (although do not list it as a referred specimen), citing the lack of low-keeled osteoderms found in other Euoplocephalus specimens like AMNH 5406, and the presence of conical osteoderms similar to those in NHMUK R5161. ROM 1930 includes a skull (, , ), three dorsal vertebrae, partial sacrum (), caudal vertebrae (), fragmentary right scapula, right humerus (), and osteoderms (including in situ osteoderms on two blocks of articulated free caudal vertebrae). Field notes by G. F. Sternberg (1914; CMN) indicate that cervical half rings may also have been collected, but these are not yet prepared. The skull lacks postocular osteoderms and the squamosal horns do not have the long, backswept morphology of those from the Two Medicine Formation. If the referral of the Two Medicine ankylosaurid material to Scolosaurus is correct, then ROM 1930 is not referable to Scolosaurus.",,,,,,,,,,,

This specimen was referred to Euoplocephalus tutus by Penkalski . However, there are few features that allow it to be confidently assigned to Ankylosauridae, let alone to a particular genus or species. The straight shaft of the broken ischium, and the rugose, thin-walled osteoderms suggest that ROM 813 is an ankylosaurid rather than a nodosaurid. ROM 813 has rectangular, keeled osteoderms, unlike those present in NHMUK R5161; and because NHMUK R5161 preserves nearly the entire dorsal integument it is unlikely that ROM 813 is referable to Scolosaurus cutleri. ROM 813 is from the lowest levels of the Dinosaur Park Formation and as such is unlikely to be referable to Anodontosaurus lambei. It does not have any triangular osteoderms such as those present on the tail of Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, but it is unclear if any of the preserved integument in ROM 813 is from the tail. At present, it is impossible to determine if ROM 813 is referable to Dyoplosaurus or Euoplocephalus.

In the rhynchosaur Stenaulorhynchus (NHMUK R36618) the lateral surfaces of the centra are gently waisted (a feature common among tetrapods: see ) and there are very shallow depressions beneath the transverse processes in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae. However, vertebral laminae, distinct fossae, foramina, and other possible indicators of pneumaticity are absent (). CT sections () show that the interior is composed of densely packed trabecular bone with no large spaces. Evidence of pneumaticity is therefore absent in Stenaulorhynchus, and potentially pneumatic features have not been reported in other rhynchosaurs , . The “deep pockets” present on the vertebrae of Howesia therefore appear to be unique among rhynchosaurs, and were considered diagnostic for this taxon by Dilkes .

Vertebrae 2–4 are relatively complete, lacking only the diapophyses and neural spines. Vertebra 1 is relatively incomplete, with only the posterior third of the centrum and neural arch preserved. Vertebra 5 is represented by the anterior half of the centrum and most of the neural arch including the left diapophysis, although the right diapophysis, postzygapophyses, and neural spine are missing. Proximal rib fragments partially obscure the left lateral surfaces of the centra and neural arches of vertebrae 2, 4 and 5. In general, cross-sections through diapophyses, centra, neural arches and spines indicate that the bony interiors of the vertebrae are comprised mostly of dense trabecular bone .

CT data for an anterior dorsal vertebra of NHMUK R3592 (see Gower ) are of higher fidelity, and reveal some details of the internal trabeculae (). In general, the interior of the element appears to be composed of densely packed trabecular bone. The bone density is quite heterogeneous, with larger intertrabecular spaces (reaching up to about 8 mm in diameter) concentrated within the neural arch, lateral to the neural canal. However, there are no clear connections between these larger spaces and external fossae/foramina, and at least some of the external foramina (e.g., those positioned dorsal to the transverse process) open into areas of dense and apparently apneumatic bone.",,,,,,,,,,,

One of these (arbitrarily referred to as “NHMUK R8667, fragment A”) is a left neural arch pedicel, broken at the level of the transverse process (). The centrodiapophyseal fossa is well preserved; its deepest part narrows to a narrow canal with an elliptical outline (approximately 7 mm by 2.5 mm wide). This canal extends dorsomedially, is infilled with dark sediment, and is clearly visible in CT cross-sections. Unfortunately, because the specimen is broken at the level of the transverse process, it is not possible to determine whether it connected to internal chambers. Two smaller foramina positioned posterior to this canal extend only a very short distance into the bone and do not connect to large internal chambers. The dorsal breakage of the neural arch fragment exposes a cross-section through the arch immediately ventral to the transverse process. Although most of the cross-section is composed of dense trabecular bone, a large oval cavity is present within the neural arch medial to the prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa. This cavity has well-defined and regular walls (), and is infilled with black sediment. Unfortunately, because of the breakage of the neural arch the total dimensions cannot be determined, or whether this cavity is connected to an external foramen.",,,,,,,,,,,

Then, McGowan &amp; Motani  considered this species to belong to Brachypterygius, mainly because it did not resemble O. icenicus enough and because they already inferred the presence of Brachypterygius in the Cambridge Greensand Member using basicranium evidence. Evidence for a referral of this humerus morphotype to Brachypterygius is, however, poor. Indeed, the largest facet on this humerus morphotype (to which the holotype of O. cantabrigiensis belongs) is the ‘median’ facet, a condition never observed in any ichthyosaur whose intermedium contacts the humerus: in these ichthyosaurs, the intermedium facet is less than half the size of the radial or the ulnar facets (B. extremus",,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the radial and ulnar facet are both invariably markedly deflected outwards in the above-mentioned taxa (ibid.), whereas only the ulnar facet is consistently deflected outwards (posteroventrally) in the humerus morphotype 3, as in ophthalmosaurine ichthyosaurs . Kear &amp; Zammit  recently casted doubt on the validity of this character by studying two in utero specimens that they referred to the platypterygiine taxon ‘Platypterygius’ australis, which presumably exhibited the same morphology. However, it is clear that the ossification of the humeri that they figure is far from complete (:); thus their shape cannot be assessed unambiguously; moreover, adults representatives of this taxon do not exhibit this peculiar morphology . The degree of deflection of the anterior facet forms a wide spectrum in humerus morphotype 3 (ophthalmosaurine), within which only some (usually small) specimens such as NHMUK 43989 (holotype of O. cantabrigiensis), CAMSM B58055, and CAMSM TN1727 partim have a slightly anterolaterally deflected anterior facet.

The centrodiapophyseal, prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal, and postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae are present and the latter fossa is better developed than in the posterior cervical vertebrae (PIN 156/108). There is no accessory lamina subdividing the centrodiapophyseal fossa, contrasting with the condition in the cervical vertebrae (PIN 156/108, 109). The left transverse process of the third anterior dorsal vertebra of PIN 156/110 is complete and is very strongly developed laterally, with a transverse length to centrum length ratio of 0.70 (: tp). This ratio resembles that observed in the anterior dorsal vertebrae of Trilophosaurus buettneri (0.84 : fig. 37), Proterosuchus fergusi (0.95, NM QR 1484) and Erythrosuchus africanus (0.85, NHMUK R3592). By contrast, proportionally shorter transverse processes are present in the anterior dorsal vertebrae of Youngina capensis (0.46, BP/1/3859), early lepidosaurs (e.g. Gephyrosaurus bridensis",,,,,,,,,,,

The postzygapophyses are separated from the posterior end of the centrum by a tall and deep notch in lateral view. Only the bases of the prezygapophyses are preserved and they are well separated transversely from one another, as is also the case for the postzygapophyses. The presence of broadly separated zygapophyses contrasts with the condition observed in the cervical vertebrae of most archosauromorphs and some “pelycosaurian” synapsids, in which the zygapophyses are placed close to each other in dorsal view (e.g. Ophiacodon sp., MCZ 1426; Prolacerta broomi, BP/1/2675; Protorosaurus speneri, ZMR MB R2173).

Clark [] identified as diagnostic a midline ridge on the dorsal surface of the parietal and frontal, transverse contact between the lacrimal and the nasal, and a frontal that extend posteriorly well beyond the anterior limits of the supratemporal fenestra. Schwarz and Salisbury [] added a list of plesiomorphic and apomorphic features to the diagnosis. One of the more interesting apomorphic features added by Schwarz and Salisbury [] was the presence of a shallow sulcus on the dorsal surface of the maxillary rostrum, immediately caudal to the junction between the maxilla, premaxilla and nasal. This feature was similarly noted by Martin et al. [] and characterized as a transversely directed groove on the anterolateral side of the maxilla. This feature had not been previously noted in T. pusillus although examination of NHMUK 48330 confirms its presence in that taxon. It is also present in T. ibericus []. Also present in Theriosuchus pusillus (and apparently most other Theriosuchus species) is a small unsculptured lobe of bone that lies at the posterior end of the lateral edge of the squamosal.

Although not preserved in the lectotype of Theriosuchus pusillus, it appears to be open in both T. sympiestodon and T. guimarotae taking the form of a sulcus that is roofed by the squamosal along its path on the quadrate. The maxillae in Shamosuchus and Theriosuchus bear a groove that begins near the orbital margin and terminates near the external naris. The frontal and parietal in both taxa have prominent midline ridges. Theriosuchus has a distinct, depressed, and smooth posterolateral “lobe” on the squamosal. This is similar to the posterolateral squamosal “lobe” present in Shamosuchus [] and Rugosuchus []. In the latter taxa there is some presence of sculpturing on the lobe. However, as noted by Clark [], sculpturing extends somewhat onto the lobe in Theriosuchus pusillus (NHMUK 48216). These comparisons require testing within a phylogenetic analysis.

If the perpendicular distances between the upper and lower tooth rows to the jaw joint are equal, then the teeth will meet simultaneously along the entire row during jaw closure . If these distances are not equal, the upper and lower teeth will shear past each other and have only a single point of contact that moves anteriorly during jaw closure. Following the method described by Greaves , the upper tooth row-to-jaw joint and lower tooth row-to-jaw joint distances are more similar to one another in Heterodontosaurus than in Tianyulong ().
