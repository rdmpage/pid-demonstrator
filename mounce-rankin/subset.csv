The main distinguishing features of the species were the alleged absence of hooklets on the suckers, number and size of the rostellar hooks (single row) and the number of uterine diverticula. However, examination of the existing syntypes (though designated as vouchers) of G. sindensis (BMNH 1982.5.13.27) has shown that suckers are in fact covered with hooklets (see ) and that there are two rows of rostellar hooks (see  and ). Hence, G. sindensis is synonymized with G. bengalensis.",,,,,,,,,,,
